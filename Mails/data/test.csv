0,Here is our forecast
1,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."
2,test successful.  way to go!!!
3,"Randy,Can you send me a schedule of the salary and level of everyone in thescheduling group.  Plus your thoughts on any changes that need to be made.(Patti S for example)Phillip"

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus.

In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.

We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC- winmail.dat"

Now or for the land closing? Investmentschedule?Investment ReturnIs Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profitsare distributed?DebtWhich entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateralis associated with eachloan?ImprovementConstructionAre these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.Terms of each loan?Uses of FundsHow will disbursements be made?  By whom?What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewingfor investors?Reports to track expenses vs plan?Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you getpaid a markup on subcontractors as ageneral contractor and paid gain out of profits?Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expensesbefore the ultimate payout of profits?Design and ConstructionWhen will design be complete?What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?What level of investor involvement will be possible during constructionplanning and permitting?Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors,vendors, and other professionals?Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan touse? Names?These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investorin a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn asmuch as possible from the process.Phillip"

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

56,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/08/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><invest@bga.com>I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lotduplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are dueto a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicatedthat he had more units under construction that would beavailable in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly differentfrom yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floorplan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.Call or email with your thoughts.Phillip"

Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.""We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,""said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. ""That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.""A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company's existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.""These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,"" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.""The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.""With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.""It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,"" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.""We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,""said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way."""

94,"Alan ComnesPhillip,I got this request.  On the gas side, I think Kean/Lay need an update to a table you prepared for me a few months ago, which I've attached..  Can you oblige?  Thanks,Alan ComnesJanel Guerrero@ENRONAlan,Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?"
95,"Mac,Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/yearEstimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcfActual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.(334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPSX 12 P/E multiple = $34 a shareThat is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.
